## Repository Map

| Domain | Repository | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Components** | [components-library](https://github.com/EricElectro/Components) | Device-level characterizations and reusable electrical models (e.g., TL431, TIP42C, LM358). Each folder includes LTspice simulations, data templates, and test procedures. |
<!-- | **Circuits** | [circuits-lab](https://github.com/EricElectro/Circuits) | Complete circuit topologies — regulators, converters, and amplifiers — with system-level simulations, measured results, and lessons learned. | -->
<!-- | **Systems** | [systems-projects](https://github.com/EricElectro/Systems) | Higher-level builds integrating multiple circuits and microcontrollers (e.g., RC car controller, power subsystem, sensing). | -->
<!-- | **Test Automation** | [equipment-control](https://github.com/EricElectro/Lab_Equipment_Control) | Python + SCPI control for lab instruments (Rigol DS1054Z, DG1022Z). Includes automation scripts, logging, and data acquisition templates. | -->


> More repositories will be added as additional modules are released.
